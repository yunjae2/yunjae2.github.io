title:	starting a blog

I do not use social networking service.
But sometimes it is needed to be connected with the world.
I have seen lots of people maintain their blogs using github pages.
It looked simple and quite easy to use.

At now, I am thinking of using this blog as a way to express myself to the world.
Things like my playlists, my works and some changes will be shared in this blog.

The blog is not complete yet. I will add some tabs and maybe comment feature
in the near future.
